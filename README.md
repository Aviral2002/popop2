# SYNTAX ERROR PROJECT

## GroupGo

### *Project Description*

This is a group buying platform that uses a "minimum purchase" requirement to offer discounted prices to consumers. As soon as the minimum number of consumers say 5, buy the commodity on the web application by paying the price, they are eligible to avail the discounted price. It also has the capability to accept cryptocurrency payments through the use of a Solana blockchain-based payment gateway.

### Tech Stacks :

-React
-MongoDb
-Node.js
-Express
-Next.js
-Solana/wallet-adapter (To connect Crypto-Wallet)
-Solana/web3 (To make transaction over the solana blockchain)
